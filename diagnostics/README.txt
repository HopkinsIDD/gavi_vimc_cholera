---<previous_simu>---	aimed for previous output data (same touchstone: 201910gavi-5), which only include five testing countries. The dataset and the code are fixed and need no update. 
---<current_simu>---  	aimed for current output data (touchstone: 201910gavi-5), which originally only have three countries for initial diagnostics, COD, KEN, and HTI. 
			New output data can be generated and uploaded to this directory for diagnostic purposes but some adjustment in the code might be needed. 
---<current_vs_previous>---	aimed for direct comparison between previous and current output data. The discrepancy could be due to either stochasticity or systematic issues.
